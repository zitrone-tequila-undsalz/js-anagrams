# Anagrams with JS

## ➡️ What is an anagram?

An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

### ➡️ Anagram examples

▪️ statue of liberty – built to stay free \
▪️ I think therefore I am – I fear to think I’m here \
▪️ monasteries – Amen stories \
▪️ meal for one – for me alone \
▪️ considerate – care is noted

Anagram.js file contains three simple anagram exercises implemented with JavaScript. Each function takes in 2 parameters: two strings.
Functions should return true if the strings are anagrams (== same length and same letters) and return false if not.
